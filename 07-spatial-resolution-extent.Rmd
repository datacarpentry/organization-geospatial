## About

This lesson covers the key spatial attributes that are needed to work with
spatial data including: Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), Extent and spatial resolution.

**R Skill Level:** Beginner - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Understand that there are necessary spatial metadata associated with and/or
embedded in the data
* Understand that there is potentially ancillary data associated with individual
elements in vector data files (like NEON tower data (point), road (line), watershed (polygon)).


## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson you will need the most current version of R, and
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

## Spatial Metadata
There are three core spatial metadata elements that are crucial to understand
in order to effectively work with spatial data:

* **Coordinate Reference System** (CRS),
* **Extent**
* **Resolution**



## Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a spatial object is just how much area does it cover. A
map of Paris has a smaller spatial extent than a map of all of France.  

### Units
The units of the extent are defined by the coordinate system that the spatial
data is in.  

### Extent in Vector Data
GRAPHIC FROM COLIN

### Extent in Raster Data
The spatial extent of a raster, represents the x,y coordinates of the corners
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like `R`, using supporting packages such as
`rgdal`, and associated raster tools have functions that allow you to view and
define the extent of a new raster.

``` {r view-extent}
# View the extent of the raster
DEM@extent

```

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/pixelDetail.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/raster2.png">
    <figcaption>If you double the extent value of a raster - the pixels will be
    stretched over the larger area making it look more "blury".
    </figcaption>
</figure>

### Calculating Raster Extent
To calculate the extent of a raster, we first need the bottom left x,y
coordinate of the raster. In
the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in meters, to calculate
the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and rows to the x,y corner
coordinate location of the raster, multiplied by the resolution (the pixel size)
of the raster.

Let's explore that next.

``` {r calculate-raster-extent}
# create a raster from the matrix
myRaster1 <- raster(nrow=4, ncol=4)

# assign some random data to the raster
myRaster1[]<- 1:ncell(myRaster1)

# view attributes of the raster
myRaster1

# is the CRS defined?
myRaster1@crs

# what are the data extents?
myRaster1@extent
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")

```

## Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image.
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/pixelDetail.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/pixelDetail.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/raster1.png">
    <figcaption>A raster at the same extent with more pixels will have a higher
    resolution (it looks more "crisp"). A raster that is stretched over the same
    extent with fewer pixels will look more blury and will be of lower resolution.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's open up a raster in `R` to see how the attributes are stored.

``` {r raster-attributes}
#load raster library
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# Load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
DEM <- raster("DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  

# View raster attributes
DEM

```

Notice that this raster (in GeoTIFF format) already has defined:

* extent
* resolution (1 in both x and y directions), and
* CRS (units in meters).
