##About
Add description.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

#Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Know the defintion of spatial data.
* understand that one can work with data from different time points for the same area (e.g., you can ask question over time using spatial data.)
* understand that one can work with data from different site to compare areas.
* Know how scientific questions can help in selection of a field site. (->why use HAVR / SJER & introduce both.) 



##Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson: you will need the most current version of R, and 
preferably RStudio, loaded on your computer.

###Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

* [More on Packages in R - Adapted from Software Carpentry.]({{site.baseurl}}R/Packages-In-R/)

###Download Data
EDIT AS NEEDED

**Raster Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series introducing
[spatial data and data management in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/URL).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}workshops/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with  
[raster data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-raster-series),
[vector data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-vector-series)
and  
[tabular time series in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/tabular-time-series).

## Thinking spatially
Challenge: 
* What makes data spatial? 
* What are examples of spatial data?  Why is dataset you come up with a spatial data set?

```{r what-spatial-data, echo=FALSE}
#Spatial data are any data that have geographical coordinates associated with them.

```

## Questions to ask of spatial data

There are many types of questions that can be addressed with spatial data.

We're interested in the Harvard Forest site. It's a NEON site that has been monitored for about 40 years. There's a lot of different data available for this site, over time and space.

-- add Harvard forest site link

We would like to create the following outputs to better understand our project.
- Plots of temperature, precipitation, PAR and daylength over the 2 year time period (metrics which are related to the greening and browning of plants)  compared to NDVI (greenness).
- Basemaps of her site showing
- The location of the tower that measured the above variables and imagery showing what the site look like.
- tree height
- Topography
- A time series animation of NDVI for both sites that she can post on her blog.
