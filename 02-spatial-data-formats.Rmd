##Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson: you will need the most current version of R, and 
preferably RStudio, loaded on your computer.

###Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

* [More on Packages in R - Adapted from Software Carpentry.]({{site.baseurl}}R/Packages-In-R/)

**Raster Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series introducing
[spatial data and data management in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/URL).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}workshops/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with  
[raster data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-raster-series),
[vector data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-vector-series)
and  
[tabular time series in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/tabular-time-series).

### Types of spatial data

Spatial data is represented in many different ways and file formats. This is often because there are different scales or measuring devices or people just
like one or the other. It can seem a little overwhelming, but these data types will generally conform to standards.

There are two broad categories of spatial data - raster and vector.


##Vector - Point, Line Polygon
- points, lines or polygons
- not spatially extensive
- used if you want to measure particular features in an area
- examples, a point is a tower, a line is a transect, river or road and a polygon is a water shed
- you can have more than one measured variable for each element

Each of these has different file types. There are a lot of file types within each category, but particular file types are associated with a particular data type.

###Shapefile vs text file (points focused)

###Attributes

##Raster 
- In a grid
- In rows and columns
- Every spot in the grid has a value - spatially extensive  
- Every grid represents a single variable - it's just measuring one thing, like elevation would be one file and soil temperature would be another file.
- The resolution or grid cell size can be different sizes between files

Maybe the Harvard forest DVM

###GeoTIFF
The raster data we'll be using are GeoTIFF.

It has the data itself in the grid as well as the coordinate reference system stored in the same file.

You have to access this data with particular tools - you can't look at it like a regular tiff. When you do access it, you can see that the coordinate information is like this:

```
dimensions  : 1367, 1697, 2319799  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
resolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)
extent      : 731453, 733150, 4712471, 4713838  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
values      : 0, 1098.62  (min, max)
```
###brief list of other raster formats not covered in these lessons

If you're interested in a particular area, you can combine information or overlay data from both of these types.

For instance we can combine the Harvard forest land cover map (raster) and the boundary of the forest (vector data) and the tower.

We're going to focus on two common examples, one for raster and one for vector, in this workshop.

You need special tools to be able to open, read and manipulate these files. We will be using R in this workshop. There's also a lot of other options including things like ArcGIS and Q-GIS and GRASS.
