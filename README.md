# Geospatial Data Organization

This lesson is built and deployed automatically using the Carpentries' Sandpaper.

Good luck.

## Contributing to lesson development

- Each time you push a change to GitHub, SandPaper rebuilds the lesson, and when it's successful (look for the green badge at the top of the README file), it publishes the result at [http://www.datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/](https://www.datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/)
