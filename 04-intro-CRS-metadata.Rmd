## What is a Coordinate Reference System

> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

The earth is round. Yet, when we make maps on paper or on a flat computer screen, 
we move from a 3-Dimensional space (the globe) to a 2-Dimensional space (our computer
screens or a piece of paper). The components of the CRS define how the
"flattening" of the 3-D globe occured in addition to defining the coordinate 
system itself.

The coordinate reference system is made up of several key components: 

* **Coodinate System:** the grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define
where a point is located in space.
* **Horizontal and vertical units:** The units used to define the grid along the 
x, y (and z) axis.
* **Datum:** The 0,0 origin of the grid.
* **Projection Information:** the mathematical equation used to flatten objects 
that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface
(e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).

### Coordinate System & Units

We can define a spatial location, such as a plot location, using an x- and a y-value.
This location, is located on a spatial grid.

For example 

# lat long example
# create a simple plot using the location in lat long

```{r lat-long-example }

```

In the example above, the grid, which we will from here on in refer to as a 
**coordinate system** being used is latitude and longitude,
which is a **Geographic Coordinate System** (described below). The units for the
coordinate system grid are in **decimal degrees**.

It is important to understand the type of coordinate system that your data uses - 
particularly if you are working with different data stored in different coordinate
systems. If you have data from the same location that are stored in different 
coordinate reference systems, **they will not line up in any GIS or other program**.

#### Same Country, Different Datums & Projections

We can start with a spatial grid to understand coordinate reference systems. We 
define a location according to it's relative location on a grid in the same way
we plot a point on a graph. However, with spatial data, we need to consider:

1. Transformation (projection):how the grid is "flattened" or transformed from a 3-d globe to be rendered 
on a 2 dimensional map 
2. Units: the units that the grid uses
3. Datum: the 0,0 reference 

There are two main types of coordinate systems:

1. **Geographic coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that span the entire
globe (e.g. latitude / longitude). 
2. **Projected coordinate Systems:** coordinate systems that are localized to 
minimize visual distortion in a particular region (e.g. UTM, State Plane)

We use different coordinate systems because each one is optimized for a particular
application. And when we make makes, certain Coordinate Reference Systems visually
are better for different regions. For example, if we are often performing 
global analysis in our 
research, we are likely to use a geographic coordinate system which is better 
suited to analysis across many countries. In contrast if we are always working in 
the state of Pennsylvania, then it might be better to use State Plane projection
for Pennsylvania.

### Geographic Coordinate Systems

A geographic coordinate system uses a grid that wraps around the entire globe.
This means that each point on the globe is defined using the SAME coordinate system. 

The origin or datum for the CRS is (0,0), located at the intersection of the 
Equator (0° latitude) and Prime Meridian (0° longitude) on the globe.

Example Geographic Coordinate Reference System: Latitude and Longitude is one of
the most commonly encountered geographic CRSs

    marked north and south from the Equator and longitude are marked east and
    west of the Prime Meridian.

</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** The distance between the 2 degrees of
longitude at the equator (0°) is ~ 69 miles. The distance between 2 degrees of 
longitude at 40°N (or S) is only 53 miles. 
{: .notice}


### Projected Coordinate Systems

## Projected CRSs

Spatial projection refers to the mathematical calculations 
performed to flatten the 3D data onto a 2D plane (our computer screen
or a paper map). Projecting data from a round surface onto a flat surface, results
in visual modifications to the data when plotted on a map. Some areas are stretched
and some some are compressed. We can see this when we look at a MAP of the entire
globe.


The mathematical calculations used in spatial projections are designed to 
optimize the relative size and shape of a particular region on the globe.

    different parts of the map.

A few common example projections, and how they optimize the visual appearance of a region
on a map, are listed below.

# make the below into a table 
* **State Plane** Region: United States. Optimized for: states
in the U.S. Sub regions:  north / south (withing hte state). Units:
Feet 
* **Universal Trans Mercator (UTM)** Region: Entire Globe, Optimized for: regions 
throughout the globe. Sub regions: north / south (above / below the equator)divides the entire globe

### About UTM

The **Universal Transverse Mercator** (UTM) system is a projected coordinate
reference system. The earth is flattened and subdivided into zones,
numbered 0-60 (equivalent to longitude) and regions (north and south)


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** UTM zones are also defined using bands,
lettered C-X (equivalent to latitude) however, the band designation is often 
dropped as it isn't esssential to specifying the location. 
{: .notice}

While UTM zones span the entire globe, UTM uses a regional 
projection and associated coordinate system. The coordinate system grid for each
zone is projected individually using the **Mercator projection**. 

The origin (0,0) for each UTM zone and associated region is located at the 
intersection of the equator and a location, 500,000 meters east of the central 
meridian of each zone. The origin location is placed outside of the boundary of 
the UTM zone, to avoid negative Easting numbers.

# edit this messy
The coordinates for the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site can be written as:
would be written as: UTM Zone 18N, 730782m, 4712631m
where the N denotes that it is in the Northern, not Southern hemisphere. Occassionally,
you may see: Zone 18T, 730782m Easting, 4712631m Northing.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip:**  The UTM system doesn't apply to polar 
regions (>80°N or S). Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) coordinate system is 
used in these area. This is where zones A, B and Y, Z are used if you were 
wondering why they weren't in the UTM lettering system.  
{: .notice }


### Datum

The datum describes the vertical and horizontal reference point of the coordinate 
system. The vertical datum describes the relationship between a specific ellipsoid 
(the top of the earth's surface) and the center of the earth. The datum also describes
the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system. 

Frequently encountered datums: 

* *WGS84* -- World Geodetic System (created in) 1984.  The origin is the center of
the earth.
* *NAD27* & *NAD83* -- North American Datum 1927 and 1983,
respectively.  The origin for NAD 27 is Meades Ranch in Kansas.
* *ED50* -- European Datum 1950

For more information, read
*  <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Datums/003r00000008000000/" target="_blank">ESRI's ArcGIS discussion of Datums.</a>

> NOTE: All coordinate reference systems have a vertical and horizontal datum
which defines a "0, 0" reference point. There are two models used to define 
the datum: **ellipsoid** (or spheroid): a mathematically representation of the shape of
the earth. Visit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article on the earth ellipsoid </a>  for more information and **geoid**: a 
model of the earth's gravitatinal field which approximates the mean sea level 
across the entire earth.  It is from this that elevation is measured. Visit 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's geoid
article </a>for more information. We will not cover these concepts in this tutorial.



### Coordinate Reference System Formats

There are numerous formats that are used to document a `CRS`. Three common
formats include:

* **proj.4**
* **EPSG**
* Well-known Text (**WKT**)
formats.  

#### PROJ or PROJ.4 strings 

PROJ.4 strings are a compact way to identify a spatial or coordinate reference 
system. PROJ.4 strings are the primary output from most of the spatial data `R`
packages that we will use (e.g. `raster`, `rgdal`).

Using the PROJ.4 syntax, we specify the complete set of parameters (e.g. elipse, datum,
units, etc) that define a particular CRS.


## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format
The `CRS` for our data are given to us by `R` in `proj4` format. Let's break
down the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual
`CRS` elements that `R` or another `GIS` might need. Each element is specified
with a `+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by 
a `,`. After each `+` we see the `CRS` element being defined. For example
`+proj=` and `+datum=`.

### UTM Proj4 String
Our project string for `point_HARV` specifies the UTM projection as follows: 

`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0` 

* **+proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **+zone=18:** the zone is 18
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **+units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in METERS.
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for 
the data is WGS84

Note that the `zone` is unique to the UTM projection. Not all `CRS` will have a 
zone.

### Geographic (lat / long) Proj4 String

Our project string for `State.boundary.US` and `Country.boundary.US` specifies
the lat/long projection as follows: 

`+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0` 

* **+proj=longlat:** the data are in a geographic (latitude and longitude)
coordinate system
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection) 
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's roundness is calculated)
is WGS84

Note that there are no specified units above. This is because this geographic 
coordinate reference system is in latitude and longitude which is most 
often recorded in *Decimal Degrees*.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** the last portion of each `proj4` string 
is `+towgs84=0,0,0 `. This is a conversion factor that is used if a `datum` 
conversion is required. We will not deal with datums in this particular series.

#### EPSG codes
The EPSG codes are a structured dataset of CRSs that are used around the world. They were
originally compiled by the, now defunct, European Petroleum Survey Group, hence the
EPSG acronym. Each code is a four digit number.  

The codes and more information can be found on these websites:

* <a href="http://spatialreference.org/" target="_blank">Spatialreference.org</a>
* <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">list of ESPG codes.</a>

``` {r crs-strings}

library('rgdal')
epsg = make_EPSG()
# View(epsg)
head(epsg)
```

#### WKT or Well-known Text
Well-known Text (WKT) allows for compact machine- and human-readable representation of
geometric objects as well as to consisely describing the critical elements of
coordinate reference system (CRS) definitions. 

The codes and more information can be found on these websites:
