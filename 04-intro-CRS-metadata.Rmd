## What is a Coordinate Reference System

To define the location of something we often use a coordinate system. This system
consists of an X and a Y value, located within a 2 (or more) -dimensional 
(as shown below) space.

	<img src="http://open.senecac.on.ca/clea/label/projectImages/15_276_xy-grid.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption> We use coordinate systems with X, Y (and sometimes Z axes) to
	define the location of objects in space.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

While the above coordinate system is 2-dimensional, we live on a 3-dimensional
earth that happens to be "round". To define the location of objects on the earth, which is round, we need
a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth's shape. When we make maps on paper 
or on a flat computer screen, we move from a 3-Dimensional space (the globe) to 
a 2-Dimensional space (our computer
screens or a piece of paper). The components of the CRS define how the
"flattening" of data that exists in a 3-D globe space. The CRS also defines the
the coordinate system itself. 

> A  coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

## The Components of a CRS

The coordinate reference system is made up of several key components: 

* **Coodinate System:** the grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define
where a point is located in space.
* **Horizontal and vertical units:** The units used to define the grid along the 
x, y (and z) axis.
* **Datum:** Defined by the shape of the origin used to place the coordinate 
system in 
space. We will explain this further, below.
* **Projection Information:** the mathematical equation used to flatten objects 
that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface
(e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).


## Why CRS is Important

It is important to understand the coordinate system that your data uses - 
particularly if you are working with different data stored in different coordinate
systems. If you have data from the same location that are stored in different 
coordinate reference systems, **they will not line up in any GIS or other program**. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Spatialreference.org provides an
excellent <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">online 
library of CRS information.</a>
{: .notice}

### Coordinate System & Units

We can define a spatial location, such as a plot location, using an x- and a
y-value - similar to our cartesian coordinate system displayed in the figure, 
above. 

For example, the map below, generated in `R` with `ggplot2` shows all of the 
continents in the world, in a `Geographic` Coordinate Reference System. The
units are Degrees and the coordinate system itself is **latitude** and
**longitude**. 

NOTE: you can <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/110m-land/" target="_blank">download globe "land" data </a> to reproduce the
plot below.

```{r lat-long-example }

library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos)
library(raster)
setwd("~/Documents/data")

# read shapefile
worldBound <- readOGR(dsn="Global/Boundaries/ne_110m_land", 
                      layer="ne_110m_land")

# convert to dataframe
worldBound_df <- fortify(worldBound)  

# plot map
worldMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  xlab("Longitude (Degrees)") + ylab("Latitude (Degrees)") +
  coord_equal() +
  ggtitle("Global Map - Geographic Coordinate System - WGS84 Datum\n Units: Degrees - Latitude / Longitude")

worldMap

```

We can add three coordinate locations to our map. Note that the UNITS are
in decimal **degrees** (latitude, longitude):

* Boulder, Colorado:  40.0274, -105.2519
* Oslo, Norway: 50.9500, 10.7500
* Mallorca, Spain: 39.6167, 2.9833

Let's create a second map with the locations overlayed on top of the continental
boundary layer.

```{r add-lat-long-locations }

# define locations of Boulder, CO and Oslo, Norway
loc <- data.frame(lon=c(-105.2519, 10.7500, 2.9833),
                lat=c(40.0274, 50.9500, 39.6167))

# convert to dataframe
loc.df <- fortify(loc)  

# add a point to the map
mapLocations <- worldMap + geom_point(data=loc.df, 
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL, colour = "purple"),
                      size=5)

mapLocations + theme(legend.position="none")

```

## Geographic CRS - The Good & The Less Good
Geographic coordinate systems in decimal degrees do a good job of helping is 
identify the location of things on the Earth, however latitude and longitude
locations are not located using uniform measurement units. Thus, geographic 
CRSs are not ideal for measuring distance. This is why other projected `CRS` 
have beend developed. 

### Robinson Projection

We can view the same data above, in another CRS - `Robinson`. `Robinson` is a 
**projected** `CRS`. Notice that the features on the map - have a different shape 
compared to the map that we created above in the `CRS`:  **Geographic lat/long WGS84**.

```{r global-map-robinson }

# reproject from longlat to robinson
worldBound_robin <- spTransform(worldBound,
                                CRS("+proj=robin"))

worldBound_df_robin <- fortify(worldBound_robin)

robMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df_robin, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  labs(title="World map (robinson)") +
  coord_equal()

robMap
```

Now what happens if you try to add the same Lat / Long coordinate locations that
we used above, to our map, with the `CRS` of `Robinsons`?

```{r add-locations-robinson }

# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc.df, 
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL, colour = "purple"),
                      size=5)

newMap + theme(legend.position="none")

```

Notice above that when we try to add lat/long coordinates to a map in a different
`CRS`, that the points are not in the correct location. We need to first convert
the points to the  new projection - a process often referred to as **reprojection**
but performed by the `spTransform()` function in `R`.

```{r reproject-robinson }

# define locations of Boulder, CO and Oslo, Norway
loc 

# convert to spatial Points data frame
loc.spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = loc,data=loc,
                            proj4string=crs(worldBound))  

loc.spdf
# reproject data to Robinson
loc.spdf.rob <- spTransform(loc.spdf, CRSobj = CRS("+proj=robin"))

loc.rob.df <- as.data.frame(cbind(loc.spdf.rob$lon,loc.spdf.rob$lat))
names(loc.rob.df ) <- c("X","Y")
loc.rob <- fortify(loc.rob.df)
# notice the coordinate system in the Robinson projection (CRS) is DIFFERENT
# from the coordinate values for the same locations in a geographic CRS.
loc.rob
# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc.rob, 
                      aes(x=X, y=Y, group=NULL, colour = "purple"),
                      size=5)

newMap + theme(legend.position="none")

```

## Why Multiple CRS?

You may be wondering, why bother with different `CRS`s if it makes our
analysis more complicated? Well, each `CRS` is optimized to best represent:

* Shape
* Scale / distance
* Area 

of features in the data. And no one CRS is great at optimizing shape, distance AND
area. Some `CRS`s are optimized for shape, some distance, some area. Some 
`CRS`s are also optimized for particular regions - 
for instance the United States, or Europe. Discussing `CRS` as it optimizes shape,
distance and area is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it's important to
understand that the `CRS` that you chose for your data, will impact working with
the data!

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge

1. Compare the maps of the globe above. What do you notice about the shape of the 
various countries. Are there any signs of distortion in certain areas on either
map? Which one is better?

2. look at the image below - which depicts maps of the United States in 4 different
`CRS`s. What visual differences do you notice in each map? Look up each projection
online, what elements (shape,area or distance) does each projection used in
the graphic below optimize?

</div>

```{r challenge-1, echo=FALSE}

## notes about robinson -- you will see distortion above 40 = 45 degrees latitude 
## it is optimized for the latitudes between 0-45 (north and south). 

## geographic - notice that the latitude lines are closer together are you move
## north...

# What each CRS optimizes:
## Mercator: 
## ALbers Equal Area
## UTM Zone 11n
## Geographic WGS84 (lat/lon): 
```

    CRS. These differences are a direct result of the

## Geographic vs Projected CRS


The above maps provide examples of the two main types of coordinate systems:

1. **Geographic coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that span the entire
globe (e.g. latitude / longitude). 
2. **Projected coordinate Systems:** coordinate systems that are localized to 
minimize visual distortion in a particular region (e.g. Robinson, UTM, State Plane)

Next, we will discuss the differences between these `CRS`s in more detail. Feel
free to skip over this section and come back to it with fresh eyes if the 
concept of a `CRS` is becoming too complex. It's easisest to take on in 
bite sized pieces!

## Geographic Coordinate Systems

A geographic coordinate system uses a grid that wraps around the entire globe.
This means that each point on the globe is defined using the SAME coordinate system. Geographic coordinate systems are best for global analysis however it 
is important to remember that distance is distorted using a geographic lat / long
`CRS`.

The **geographic WGS84 lat/long** `CRS` has an origin - (0,0) -
located at the intersection of the 
Equator (0Â° latitude) and Prime Meridian (0Â° longitude) on the globe.

```{r, geographic-WGS84, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE }

# read grat shapefile
worldGrat30 <- readOGR(dsn="../../Global/Boundaries/ne_110m_graticules_all", 
                      layer="ne_110m_graticules_30")
# convert to dataframe
worldGrat30_df <- fortify(worldGrat30) 

#import box
wgs84Box <- readOGR("../../Global/Boundaries/ne_110m_graticules_all",
                    layer="ne_110m_wgs84_bounding_box") 
wgs84Box_df<- fortify(wgs84Box)

#plot data
ggplot(wgs84Box_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) + 
  geom_polygon(fill="white") +
  xlab("Longitude (Degrees)") + ylab("Latitude (Degrees)") +
  ggtitle("World Map - Geographic WGS84 (lat/lon)") +
  geom_polygon(data=worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group, fill=hole))+
  geom_path(data=worldGrat30, aes(long, lat, group=group, fill=NULL), linetype="dashed", color="grey50") +
  labs(title="World map + graticule (longlat)") + 
  coord_equal() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "white"), guide="none") # change colors & 
```



<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** The distance between the 2 degrees of
longitude at the equator (0Â°) is ~ 69 miles. The distance between 2 degrees of 
longitude at 40Â°N (or S) is only 53 miles. However measures of distance when using
lat/long project are not uniform.

## Projected Coordinate Reference Systems


Spatial projection refers to the mathematical calculations 
performed to flatten the 3D data onto a 2D plane (our computer screen
or a paper map). Projecting data from a round surface onto a flat surface, results
in visual modifications to the data when plotted on a map. Some areas are stretched
and some some are compressed. We can see this when we look at a MAP of the entire
globe.


The mathematical calculations used in spatial projections are designed to 
optimize the relative size and shape of a particular region on the globe.

    <figcaption>The 3-dimensional globe must be transformed to create a flat
    2-dimensional map. How that transformation or **projection** occurs changes

    different parts of the map.

</figure>

A few common example projections, and how they optimize the visual appearance of a region
on a map, are listed below.

# make the below into a table 
* **State Plane** Region: United States. Optimized for: states
in the U.S. Sub regions:  north / south (withing hte state). Units:
Feet 
* **Universal Trans Mercator (UTM)** Region: Entire Globe, Optimized for: regions 
throughout the globe. Sub regions: north / south (above / below the equator)divides the entire globe

### About UTM

The **Universal Transverse Mercator** (UTM) system is a projected coordinate
reference system. The earth is flattened and subdivided into zones,
numbered 0-60 (equivalent to longitude) and regions (north and south)


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** UTM zones are also defined using bands,
lettered C-X (equivalent to latitude) however, the band designation is often 
dropped as it isn't esssential to specifying the location. 
{: .notice}

While UTM zones span the entire globe, UTM uses a regional 
projection and associated coordinate system. The coordinate system grid for each
zone is projected individually using the **Mercator projection**. 

The origin (0,0) for each UTM zone and associated region is located at the 
intersection of the equator and a location, 500,000 meters east of the central 
meridian of each zone. The origin location is placed outside of the boundary of 
the UTM zone, to avoid negative Easting numbers.

# edit this messy
The coordinates for the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site can be written as:
would be written as: UTM Zone 18N, 730782m, 4712631m
where the N denotes that it is in the Northern, not Southern hemisphere. Occassionally,
you may see: Zone 18T, 730782m Easting, 4712631m Northing.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip:**  The UTM system doesn't apply to polar 
regions (>80Â°N or S). Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) coordinate system is 
used in these area. This is where zones A, B and Y, Z are used if you were 
wondering why they weren't in the UTM lettering system.  
{: .notice }


### Datum

The datum describes the vertical and horizontal reference point of the coordinate 
system. The vertical datum describes the relationship between a specific ellipsoid 
(the top of the earth's surface) and the center of the earth. The datum also describes
the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system. 

Frequently encountered datums: 

* *WGS84* -- World Geodetic System (created in) 1984.  The origin is the center of
the earth.
* *NAD27* & *NAD83* -- North American Datum 1927 and 1983,
respectively.  The origin for NAD 27 is Meades Ranch in Kansas.
* *ED50* -- European Datum 1950

For more information, read
*  <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Datums/003r00000008000000/" target="_blank">ESRI's ArcGIS discussion of Datums.</a> 
*  <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf" target="_blank">page 2 in M. Fraiser's CRS Overview.</a> 


> NOTE: All coordinate reference systems have a vertical and horizontal datum
which defines a "0, 0" reference point. There are two models used to define 
the datum: **ellipsoid** (or spheroid): a mathematically representation of the shape of
the earth. Visit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article on the earth ellipsoid </a>  for more information and **geoid**: a 
model of the earth's gravitatinal field which approximates the mean sea level 
across the entire earth.  It is from this that elevation is measured. Visit 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's geoid
article </a>for more information. We will not cover these concepts in this tutorial.



### Coordinate Reference System Formats

There are numerous formats that are used to document a `CRS`. Three common
formats include:

* **proj.4**
* **EPSG**
* Well-known Text (**WKT**)
formats.  

#### PROJ or PROJ.4 strings 

PROJ.4 strings are a compact way to identify a spatial or coordinate reference 
system. PROJ.4 strings are the primary output from most of the spatial data `R`
packages that we will use (e.g. `raster`, `rgdal`).

Using the PROJ.4 syntax, we specify the complete set of parameters (e.g. elipse, datum,
units, etc) that define a particular CRS.


## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format
The `CRS` for our data are given to us by `R` in `proj4` format. Let's break
down the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual
`CRS` elements that `R` or another `GIS` might need. Each element is specified
with a `+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by 
a `,`. After each `+` we see the `CRS` element being defined. For example
`+proj=` and `+datum=`.

### UTM Proj4 String
Our project string for `point_HARV` specifies the UTM projection as follows: 

`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0` 

* **+proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **+zone=18:** the zone is 18
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **+units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in METERS.
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for 
the data is WGS84

Note that the `zone` is unique to the UTM projection. Not all `CRS` will have a 
zone.

### Geographic (lat / long) Proj4 String

Our project string for `State.boundary.US` and `Country.boundary.US` specifies
the lat/long projection as follows: 

`+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0` 

* **+proj=longlat:** the data are in a geographic (latitude and longitude)
coordinate system
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection) 
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's roundness is calculated)
is WGS84

Note that there are no specified units above. This is because this geographic 
coordinate reference system is in latitude and longitude which is most 
often recorded in *Decimal Degrees*.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** the last portion of each `proj4` string 
is `+towgs84=0,0,0 `. This is a conversion factor that is used if a `datum` 
conversion is required. We will not deal with datums in this particular series.

#### EPSG codes
The EPSG codes are a structured dataset of CRSs that are used around the world. They were
originally compiled by the, now defunct, European Petroleum Survey Group, hence the
EPSG acronym. Each code is a four digit number.  

The codes and more information can be found on these websites:

* <a href="http://spatialreference.org/" target="_blank">Spatialreference.org</a>
* <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">list of ESPG codes.</a>

``` {r crs-strings}

library('rgdal')
epsg = make_EPSG()
# View(epsg)
head(epsg)
```

#### WKT or Well-known Text
Well-known Text (WKT) allows for compact machine- and human-readable representation of
geometric objects as well as to consisely describing the critical elements of
coordinate reference system (CRS) definitions. 

The codes and more information can be found on these websites: 
* <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html#43" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium WKT document. </a>
