##Spatial Metadata
There are three core spatial metadata elements that are crucial to understand
in order to effectively work with any sort of spatial data: 

* Coordinate Reference System (CRS), 
* Extent
* Resolution 

##What is a Coordinate Reference System
> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a 
coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical 
entities. -- Wikipedia

The earth is round. This is not an new concept by any means, however we need to 
remember this when we talk about coordinate reference systems associated with 
spatial data. When we make maps on paper or on a computer screen, we are moving 
from a 3 dimensional space (the globe) to 2 dimensions (our computer screens or 
a piece of paper). To keep this short, the projection of a dataset relates to 
how the data are "flattened" in geographic space so our human eyes and brains 
can make sense of the information in 2 dimensions. 

###Coordinate System

###Coordinate Units
x,y values for point locations - Examples: UTM coordinates: (meters) or in decimal degrees (lat long) or in feet (state plane)

###Datum - how and where 0,0 is defined), 
examples: geographic - 00 is...

##Projection for CRS
The projection refers to the mathematical calculations performed to "flatten the 
data" in into 2D space. The coordinate system references to the x and y
coordinate space that is associated with the projection used to flatten the
data. If you have the same dataset saved in two different projections, these two
files won't line up correctly when rendered together.

####How Map Projections Can Fool the Eye
Check out this short video highlighting how map projections can make continents 
seems proportionally larger or smaller than they actually are!

##What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and 
projections in greater detail. However, for the purposes of this activity, what 
is important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in 
different projections **will not line up in any GIS or other program**. Thus 
it's important when working with spatial data in a program like `R` or `Python` 
to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data, and to grab 
that information and retain it when you process / analyze the data.

*<a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">A great online 
library of CRS information.</a>

## CRS Strings

``` {r crs-strings}

library('rgdal')
epsg = make_EPSG()
#View(epsg)
head(epsg)
```

#Geographic vs Projected Coordinate Systems
(covered on the NCEAS page too so we don’t have to go into it beyond a sentence or two and then a link out)

Lat Long: geographic, 
units: decimal degrees
Scale: global

UTM: Projected
Easting / Northing
Units (meters or feet) - most often meters
Scale - Regional (globe divided into zones)

##Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a raster, represents the x,y coordinates of the corners 
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell 
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel 
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like `R`, using supporting packages such as
`rgdal`, and associated raster tools have functions that allow you to view and
define the extent of a new raster. 

``` {r view-extent}
# View the extent of the raster
DEM@extent

```

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/raster2.png">
    <figcaption>If you double the extent value of a raster - the pixels will be
    stretched over the larger area making it look more "blury".
    </figcaption>
</figure>
###Units

###Extent in Raster Data

###Extent in Vector Data

###Calculating Raster Extent
Extent and spatial resolution are closely connected. To calculate the extent of
a raster, we first need the bottom left (x,y) coordinate of the raster. In 
the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in meters, to calculate
the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and rows to the x,y corner 
coordinate location of the raster, multiplied by the resolution (the pixel size) 
of the raster.

Let's explore that next.

``` {r calculate-raster-extent}
#create a raster from the matrix
myRaster1 <- raster(nrow=4, ncol=4)
    
#assign some random data to the raster
myRaster1[]<- 1:ncell(myRaster1)
    
#view attributes of the raster
myRaster1

#is the CRS defined?
myRaster1@crs

#what are the data extents?
myRaster1@extent
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")
```

##Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions 
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel 
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the 
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. 
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in 
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/pixelDetail.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hyperspectral/pixelDetail.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell 
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel 
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialData/raster1.png">
    <figcaption>A raster at the same extent with more pixels will have a higher
    resolution (it looks more "crisp"). A raster that is stretched over the same
    extent with fewer pixels will look more blury and will be of lower resolution.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's open up a raster in `R` to see how the attributes are stored.

``` {r raster-attributes}
#load raster library
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
    
# Load raster in an R object called 'DEM'
DEM <- raster("DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")  
    
# View raster attributes 
DEM

```

Notice that this raster (in GeoTIFF format) already has defined:

* extent
* resolution (1 in both x and y directions), and
* CRS (units in meters).

###Adjust Raster Resolution
We can resample the raster as well to adjust the resolution. If we want a higher
resolution raster, we will apply a grid with MORE pixels within the same extent.
If we want a LOWER resolution raster, we will apply a grid with LESS pixels
within the same extent.

``` {r change-raster-resolution}
myRaster2 <- raster(nrow=8, ncol=8)
myRaster2 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster2, method='bilinear')
myRaster2

plot(myRaster2, main="Raster with 32 pixels")

myRaster3 <- raster(nrow=2, ncol=2)
myRaster3 <- resample(myRaster1, myRaster3, method='bilinear')
myRaster3

plot(myRaster3, main="Raster with 4 pixels")

myRaster4

plot(myRaster4, main="Raster with 1 pixels")
```
