The goal of this lesson is to provide an introduction to core geospatial
data concepts. It is intended as a pre-requisite for 
the [R for Raster and Vector Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson
for learners who have no prior experience working with geospatial data. This lesson can
be taught in approximately 75 minutes hours and covers the following topics:

- Introduction to raster and vector data format and attributes
- Examples of data types commonly stored in raster vs vector format
- Introduction to categorical vs continuous raster data and multi-layer rasters
- Introduction to the file types and R packages used in the remainder of this workshop
- Introduction to coordinate reference systems and the PROJ4 format
- Overview of commonly used program and applications for working with geospatial data

The [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) 
lesson provides an introduction to the R programming language 
while the [R for Raster and Vector Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson
provides a more in-depth introduction to visualization (focusing on geospatial data),
and working with data structures unique to geospatial data. The R for Raster and Vector Data assumes that learners are already familiar with both geospatial 
data concepts and the core concepts of the R language.
