LiDAR or Light Detection and Ranging is an active remote sensing system that can be used to measure vegetation height across wide areas. The activities on this page will introduce you to the core concepts surrounding:

1. How lidar systems work
2. What information the data provide.
3. How to view and work with LiDAR data using free tools
4. The key raster (gridded) lidar data products including the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DSM, also know as an digital elevation model). 
4. Basic data analysis techniques using the R programming language.
