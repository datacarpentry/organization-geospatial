##About
Add description.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

After completing this activity, you will:

* 


##Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson: you will need the most current version of R, and 
preferably RStudio, loaded on your computer.

###Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

* [More on Packages in R - Adapted from Software Carpentry.]({{site.baseurl}}R/Packages-In-R/)

###Download Data
EDIT AS NEEDED

**Raster Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series introducing
[spatial data and data management in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/URL).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}workshops/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with  
[raster data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-raster-series),
[vector data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-vector-series)
and  
[tabular time series in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/tabular-time-series).

##This lesson overviews Gui vs Non Gui tools, interactive vs non-interactive (nice graphic could go a long way here)

##Gui Tools - Brief Description of this and a few examples of available tools. BRIEF discussion of why coding is potentially more reproducible compared to gui workflows

###Pay: Arcgis

###Open / Free: QGIS, Grass (maybe a line on each and a link to each page

##Non Gui Tools

###R

###Python

###Matlab

###Benefits: Reproducible workflows, more easily documented (inline comments, etc)

##Overview of spatial data formats -- essentially one line about this with a link to the spatial data formats page.

##Packages specific to R - with link to the setting up your work environment page >>  Move to L04: Set Up a Spatial Working Evironment in R: R Packages for Spatial Data
