This tutorial introduces the spatial data tool landscape. It
covers the types of gui and non-gui tools that are available. The tutorial
explores the benefits (and challenges) of using a non-gui (coding) approach to
method development that supports clear documentation of methods.

**R Skill Level:** None. This tutorial is in a series with data skills
intensive tutorials in the `R` programming language, however, the conceptual
topics presented here relate to all programming languages!

# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Be aware of a variety of tools that can be used to access spatial data.

## This lesson overviews Gui vs Non-Gui tools, interactive vs non-interactive
(nice graphic could go a long way here)

## Gui Tools -
Brief Description of this and a few examples of available tools. BRIEF discussion of why coding is potentially more reproducible compared to gui workflows

### Pay:

* ESRI ArcGIS

### Open / Free: QGIS, Grass (maybe a line on each and a link to each page

## Non Gui Tools
  Benefits: Reproducible workflows, more easily documented (inline comments, etc)

### R

### Python

### Matlab, IDL

## Commonly found spatial data formats
essentially one line about this with a link to the spatial data formats page.

### Shapefiles (.shp, dbf, etc - group of files )

### Geodatabases (.gdb, ??)

### Csvâ€™s (.csv)

### text files: rasters (.asc) -- essentially one line about this with a link to the spatial data formats page.

### Online: geojson,

## Packages specific to R - with link to the setting up your work environment page

### Raster

### RGDAL

### RasterVis
