##Intro to CRS
What is a coordinate system?
Tells you where you are on the surface of the Earth
To tell you where you are, you need three pieces of information
- ellipsoid, projection datum

Think about a globe of the earth. It's a 3D ellipsoid. You don't work with globes though, instead we work with maps, 2D representations of the earth or areas of the earth. To move from that 3D to the 2D representation, we need
to know certain things about how that projection was done.

You need to know what model of the earth you're using, (ellipsoid) how you've created your 2D map from the 3D earth (projection) and what's the central reference point of the map (datum).

When you're working with spatial data, you want all the maps that you're working with to employ the same coordinate system.

Lattitude and longitude is a coordinate system, because it does tell you where you are on the earth. But, because it's dealing with the 3D earth, it doesn't have a projection. It does have a datum, which is 0 longitude, 0 latitude, where the Prime Meridian and Equator meet.

Another unit system is Northings and Eastings, and this is often used with GPS units. In this coordinate system, the ellipsoid is WGS84 (link to WGS84 and/or a list of types), the projection is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and the datum varies depending on where you are. In the US it's usually NAD83.

If you were at the Washington Monument in Washington DC for example, you would report your Northings and Eastings coordinates as:

XXX m North, YYY m East, UTM Zone 18
and that says that you're XXX m north and YYY m East of the zero point for Zone 18, which is the lower left of that zone.

Once you know all this information, you can convert site location between coordinate systems.

###Proj vs EPSG

###What is projection (very very high level)

##Intro to EXTENT

###Units

###Extent in raster data (rasters are always rectangles / squares)

###vectors - extent represents the outermost boundary of vertices in the spatial shapefile.
