## About Vector Data

Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earth's surface, and
assign attributes to those features. Vectors are composed of discrete geometric
locations (x, y values) known as vertices that define the shape of the spatial
object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that we
are working with: point, line or polygon.

* **Points:** Each point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. There can be
many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include: sampling
locations, the location of individual trees, or the location of survey plots.

* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) points that are connected.
For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is
composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream represents a
vertex that has defined x, y location.

* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and
closed. The outlines of survey plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or
countries are often represented by polygons.

> Sometimes, boundary layers such as states and countries, are stored as lines
>  rather than polygons. However, these boundaries, when represented as a line,
>  will not create a closed object with a defined area that can be filled.

Vector data has some important advantages:  
  * The geometry itself contains information about what the dataset creator thought was important  
  * The geometry structures hold information in themselves - why choose point over polygon, for instance?  
  * Each geometry feature can carry multiple attributes instead of just one, e.g. a database of cities can have attributes for name, country, population, etc  
  * Data storage can be very efficient compared to rasters  
  
The downsides of vector data include:
  * potential loss of detail compared to raster  
  * potential bias in datasets - what didn't get recorded?  
  * Calculations involving multiple vector layers need to do math on the
    geometry as well as the attributes, so can be slow compared to raster math.

Vector datasets are in use in many industries besides geospatial fields. For
instance, computer graphics are largely vector-based, although the data
structures in use tend to join points using arcs and complex curves rather than
straight lines. Computer-aided design (CAD) is also vector- based. The
difference is that geospatial datasets are accompanied by information tying
their features to real-world locations.

## Vector Data Format for this Workshop

Like raster data, vector data can also come in many different formats. For this
workshop, we will use the Shapefile format which has the extension `.shp`. A
`.shp` file stores the geographic coordinates of each vertice in the vector, as
well as metadata including:

* **Extent** - the spatial extent of the shapefile (i.e. geographic area that
the shapefile covers). The spatial extent for a shapefile represents the
combined extent for all spatial objects in the shapefile.
* **Object type** - whether the shapefile includes points, lines, or polygons.
* **Coordinate reference system (CRS)**
* **Other attributes** - ror example, a line shapefile that contains the
locations of streams, might contain the name of each stream.

Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

> ## Why not both?
>
> Very few formats can contain both raster and vector data - in fact, most are
> even more restrictive than that. Vector datasets are usually locked to one
> geometry type, e.g. points only. Raster datasets can usually only encode one
> data type, for example you can't have a multiband GeoTIFF where one layer is
> integer data and another is floating-point. There are sound reasons for this -
> format standards are easier to define and maintain, and so is metadata. The
> effects of particular data manipulations are more predictable if you are
> confident that all of your input data has the same characteristics.
