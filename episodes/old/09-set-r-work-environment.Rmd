## About
Add description.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.


# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

*
* Understand that different spatial data types & associated file types require
different tools to work with them.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson you will need the most current version of R, and
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.
