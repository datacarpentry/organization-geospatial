This tutorial provides an overview of key spatial data concepts, including structures and common storage and transfer formats.

**Skill Level:** This tutorial provides conceptual background for the Data Carpentry
geospatial tutorial series. The concepts outlined in this tutorial relate to many 
programming languages and data types!


# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Understand the data structures used to represent spatial information, including their strengths and weaknesses
* Become familiar with common storage and transfer formats
* Understand how those formats are currently represented in R and in Python **(too much???)**

All of the topics below are covered in more detail in later episodes. This episode just provides enough background to help you get started with a spatial data project. 

# Structures: Raster and Vector

## Raster

Potential high detail
'unstructured' beyond grid organisation - no implicit weighting of information.
Can be continuous or categorical
Imagery as a special case


## Vector

The geometry structures highlight important features/patterns in themselves - what did we choose to represent with the points, lines or polygons? 
Can build networks/connections with some 
Potential loss of detail compared to raster


## Coordinate Reference Systems

Not truly spatial until its connected to a real world location (e.g. vs a raster of the Mona Lisa, or CAD vector representation of a microprocessor)

Mention PROJ and GDAL for translating data


## Metadata

!!

# Common storage formats

What is required for a storage format to be good? Ability to store CRS and metadata along with the data itself, ???

## Raster

Geotiff, ??? NetCDF?

## Vector

Shp GPKG TAB GDB

Network-aware formats??

## Both

GeoPDF? Geospatial Databases.

# Common transfer formats

Some GIS applications have their own on-disk formats, e.g. GRASS, SAGA. If only one app can open a file, its not a good choice as a transfer standard.

Talk about GDAL here

Some simplified transfer standards eg KML, GeoJSON, csv, even plain text (GPS NMEA sentences). Mention reasons why these might be useful

note that many not truly spatial, or not fully spatial e.g. GeoJSON only supports one CRS


# What about spatial data in R or python?

R spatial packages use GDAL so they can consume any format that GDAL can read/write.

all inputs are converted to a limited set of structures defined by sp, sf, or raster (or that point pattern stuff...?)

idk what python does???

Next lesson, setting up a spatial data project in R
