This tutorial provides an overview of key spatial data concepts, including structures and common storage and transfer formats.

**Skill Level:** This tutorial provides conceptual background for the Data Carpentry
geospatial tutorial series. The concepts outlined in this tutorial relate to many 
programming languages and data types!


# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Understand the data structures used to represent spatial information, including their strengths and weaknesses
* Become familiar with common storage and transfer formats
* Understand how those formats are currently represented in R and in Python **(too much???)**

All of the topics below are covered in more detail in later episodes. This episode just provides enough background to help you get started with a spatial data project. 

# Structures: Raster and Vector

## Raster

The raster data structure is a regular grid of equally-sized cells, each holding a single numeric value. The cell values can represent a continuous surface (e.g. elevation) or a categorical classification (e.g. land use). If this sounds familiar, it is because this data structure is very common: its how we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the raster's extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and its coordinate reference system (CRS, more on this later). 

Raster data has some important advantages:

  * representation of continuous surfaces
  * potentially very high levels of detail
  * Data is 'unweighted' across its extent - the geometry doesn't implicitly highlight
    features (wording?? unbiased?)
  * Cell-by-cell calculations can be very fast and efficient
  
The downsides of raster data are

  * very large file sizes as cell size gets smaller
  * currently popular formats don't embed metadata well (more on this later!)
  * can be difficult to represent complex information
  
Satellite imagery is probably the most complex raster representation you will work with. Satellites like Landsat capture information at multiple wavelengths, from both human-visible and infrared bands. Final products are split into specific wavelength ranges, so to make a colour image of the land surface, one may have to combine red, green, and blue datasets. 

_nb shld talk to Lovelace et al about borrowing some images from - https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/spatial-class.html#raster-data, for both r and v_

## Vector

Vector data structures aim to represent specific features on the Earth's surface, and then assign attributes to those features. All vector datasets are based around coordinate points - usually paired x,y values in 2D space. There are many possible way to arrange and connect a set of points, so some standards have been developed to keep vector formats interoperable. The most common standard you will encounter is OGC Simple Features.

Simple Features defines 17 types of vector geometry, and the vast majority of data uses just three of these classes - Points, Lines, and Polygons. Points are assembled into more complex structures by straight lines only.

<image>

A Point is just a single x,y coordinate pair. A line made when at least two points are grouped together. A polygon requires at least three points, and then a fourth point that matches the first one. The points defining lines and polygons also need to be arranged in a sensible sequence to be valid - if you draw straight lines between each point, those lines should never cross. Following these rules makes it possible to do complex geometric operations by layering vector datasets together.

Vector data has some important advantages:

  * The geometry itself contains information about what the dataset creator thought was important
  * The geometry structures hold information in themselves - why choose point over polygon, for instance?
  * Each geometry feature can carry multiple attributes instead of just one, e.g. a database of cities can have attributes for name, country, population, etc
  * Data storage can be very efficient compared to rasters
  
The downsides of vector data are

  * potential loss of detail compared to raster
  * potential bias in datasets - what didn't get recorded?
  * Calculations involving multiple vector layers need to do math on the geometry as well as the attributes, so can be slow compared to raster math

Vector datasets are in use in many industries besides geospatial. For instance, computer graphics are largely vector-based, although the data structures in use tend to join points using arcs and complex curves rather than straight lines. Computer-aided design (CAD) is also vector-based. The difference is, again, that geospatial datasets are accompanied by information tying their features to real-world locations. Its time to talk about how that works.

_<worth mentioning arc-node topology yet? probs leave until specific vector lesson>_

## Coordinate Reference Systems

Not truly spatial until its connected to a real world location (e.g. vs a raster of the Mona Lisa, or CAD vector representation of a microprocessor)

Mention PROJ and GDAL for translating data


## Metadata

!!

# Common storage formats

What is required for a storage format to be good? Ability to store CRS and metadata along with the data itself, ???

## Raster

Geotiff, ??? NetCDF?

## Vector

Shp GPKG TAB GDB

Network-aware formats??

## Both

GeoPDF? Geospatial Databases.

# Common transfer formats

Some GIS applications have their own on-disk formats, e.g. GRASS, SAGA. If only one app can open a file, its not a good choice as a transfer standard.

Talk about GDAL here

Some simplified transfer standards eg KML, GeoJSON, csv, even plain text (GPS NMEA sentences). Mention reasons why these might be useful

note that many not truly spatial, or not fully spatial e.g. GeoJSON only supports one CRS


# What about spatial data in R or python?

R spatial packages use GDAL so they can consume any format that GDAL can read/write.

all inputs are converted to a limited set of structures defined by sp, sf, or raster (or that point pattern stuff...?)

idk what python does???

Next lesson, setting up a spatial data project in R
