## Workshop Goal

Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.

## Getting Started
Data Carpentry’s teaching is **hands-on**, so participants are encouraged to use their **own computers** to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow.   
\
To most effectively use these materials, **please make sure to download the data and install everything before working through this lesson.**

## About the Data
The data and lessons in this workshop were originally developed through a hackathon funded by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) - an NSF funded observatory in Boulder, Colorado - in collaboration with Data Carpentry, SESYNC and CYVERSE. NEON is collecting data for 30 years to help scientists understand how aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are changing. The data used in these lessons cover two NEON field sites:  
\
Harvard Forest (HARV) - Massachusetts, USA  
San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) - California, USA  

## The Files
| Dataset | File name | Description |
| ---- | ------| ---- | 
| Site layout shapefiles | NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files.zip | A set of shapefiles for the NEON's Harvard Forest field site and US and (some) state boundary layers. | 
 | Meteorological data |  NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series.zip | Precipitation, temperature and other variables collected from a flux tower at the NEON Harvard Forest site
 | Airborne remote sensing data | NEON-DS-Airborne-RemoteSensing.zip | LiDAR data collected by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) and processed at NEON including a canopy height model, digital elevation model and digital surface model for NEON's Harvard Forest and San Joaquin Experimental Range field sites. | 
 | Landstat 7 NDVI raster data | NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI.zip | 2011 NDVI data product derived from Landsat 7 and processed by USGS cropped to NEON's Harvard Forest and San Joaquin Experimental Range field sites |

## Sticky Notes
Each learner has two sticky notes - green and pink
* If you are following along well, or have completed an exercise, put the green sticky note on your laptop  
\
* If you run into a problem and need help,  put up the pink one and a helper can assist them.

## CRS
Questions:  
* "What is a coordinate reference system and how do I interpret one?"  
\
Objectives:  
* "Name some common schemes for describing coordinate reference systems."
* "Interpret a PROJ4 coordinate reference system description."  
\
Keypoints:  
* "All geospatial datasets (raster and vector) are associated with a specific coordinate reference system."
* "A coordinate reference system includes datum, projection, and additional parameters specific to the

## Projections

## Components of a CRS

CRS information has three components:

* **Datum:** A model of the shape of the earth.  
     - In this workshop, we will use the
[WGS84
datum](https://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-system/datums-projections-and-heights/geodetic-datums/world-geodetic-system-1984-wgs84)  
\
* **Projection:** A mathematical transformation of the angular measurements on a
round earth to a flat surface (i.e. paper or a computer screen).  
\
* **Additional Parameters:** e.g., center of the map. 

## A datum is the choice of fruit to use

![fruits](../fig/citrus.jpg)

## A projection is how you peel your orange and then flatten the peel
![](../fig/orange-peel-earth.jpg)  

[Image source](http://blogs.lincoln.ac.nz/gis/2017/03/29/where-on-earth-are-we/)

## A PROJ4 string includes the following

* **proj=:** the projection of the data
* **zone=:** the zone of the data (this is specific to the UTM projection)
* **datum=:** the datum use
* **units=:** the units for the coordinates of the data
* **ellps=:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
the data

## UTM Zones
![The UTM zones across the continental United States.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Utm-zones-USA.svg)

## Exercise: Reading a PROJ4 String
Here is a PROJ4 string for one of the datasets we will use in this workshop:  
\
`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`  
\
 
* What projection, zone, datum, and ellipsoid are used for this data?
* What are the units of the data?
* Using the map above, what part of the United States was this data collected from?

## The Landscape of GIS
Questions:  
- "What programs and applications are available for working with geospatial data?"  
\
Objectives:
- "Describe the difference between various approaches to geospatial computing, and their relative strengths and weaknesses."
- "Name some commonly used GIS applications."
- "Name some commonly used R packages that can access and process spatial data."
- "Describe pros and cons for working with geospatial data using a command-line versus a graphical user interface."  
\
Keypoints:
- "Many software packages exist for working with geospatial data."
- "Command-line programs allow you to automate and reproduce your work."
- "The RStudio GUI provides a user-friendly interface for working with R."


## Benefits of using a GUI
- Tools are all laid out in front of you
- Complex commands are easy to build
- Don't need to learn a coding language
- Cartography and visualisation is more intuitive and flexible
  
## Downsides of using a GUI
- Low reproducibility - you can't record your actions and replay
- Most are not designed for batch-processing files
- Limited ability to customise functions or write your own
- Intimidating interface for new users - so many buttons!

## Today's Pacakges in R
* `sf` for working with vector data   
\
* `raster` for working with raster data  
\
* `rgdal` for an R-friendly GDAL interface
