##About
Add description.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

#Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* 


##Things You’ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson: you will need the most current version of R, and 
preferably RStudio, loaded on your computer.

###Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

* [More on Packages in R - Adapted from Software Carpentry.]({{site.baseurl}}R/Packages-In-R/)

###Download Data
EDIT AS NEEDED
{% include/dataSubsets/_data_Airborne-Remote-Sensing.html %}

**Raster Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series introducing
[spatial data and data management in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/URL).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}workshops/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with  
[raster data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-raster-series),
[vector data in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/spatial-vector-series)
and  
[tabular time series in `R` ]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial/tabular-time-series).

##What is it?
With spatial data there is information that's necessary to understand it, but usually isn't included in the file.  This is the metadata. Data about the data.

Use a file type. Show the raster of Harvard forest. Ask, what can you say
about this data?

What would you want/need to know about this data to be able to answer questions using this data?

- where is this?
- what coordinate system?
- date?
- time?
- instrument?
- what's being measured?
- what units?

With this file type as is, can you figure any of these things out?

No, you can't figure this out. You need the data about the data. This is the metadata. This information is sometimes embedded in the file (we'll talk about this) or a separate file that contains this information. Sometimes it's in the download directory, but other times, it's just listed on a web site or in another directory and you need to seek it out.

-- show cropland data layer as an example of a data repository that has the metadata on its web site, not when you download it

Metadata comes in many formats, but generally is a text file like txt, CSV or XML.

 Ancillary data

Each element in the file can have more data associated with it. This can be things like a measured time series for an individual point or vector.

This is often things like CSV files. They don't have a spatial element. You have to attach that data to the spatial data information.

There also can be raster or vector data for the same area over time.

All these different data types and series can be combined or compared.

##Where to find it? 

##Formats (very high level):
** provide examples of each of the above - we have that from the harvard met data and the EML file- i can pull XML and a file with a header - the daylength files have a header i think?
###EML
** link out to EML lesson (in NEON-DS-Lesson-Development Repo: {{ site.baseurl }}/R/EML)

###XML

###Web pages with text

###HEADERS of text files

 
little activities to go look at metadata…
